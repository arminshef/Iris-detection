# Iris-detection
In this project we have used MLP to classify the Iris flowers
Generally, there are 7 steps in data science that are considered well in this project:
1 - Data collection\n
2 - Data prepration\n
3 - Exploratory data analysis
4 - Model building
5 - Model testing
6 - Model deployment
7 - Model optimization

In this project the dataset is downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris. Then the data are preprocessed in order to get rid of missing and 
unformatted values. It can be loaded in SQL tables that can be done in the future. Besides, the Artificial Neural Network has been selected as the model. Thus,
the hyper-parameters such as learning rate and momentum has been decided that can be tuned by variable methods and techniques. It would be appreciated to know 
about your suggestions. Please email me : armin_sheibani@shahroodut.ac.ir. In the near future, the flask would be employed to deploy the model as a web application.
